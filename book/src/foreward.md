# Earth Environments Book

## Foreward 
This project was implemented by [Caelan Langdon](https://github.com/clangdo),
[Chase Parker](https://github.com/alanparkerc), and
[Brandi](https://github.com/BrandiCook) as our senior project for
<nobr>CS 461</nobr>, 462, and 463 at Oregon State University's undergraduate program. We
worked on this project under the excellent guidance of Dr. Chris
Patton, proprieter of Patton Dynamics, LLC.

As part of a larger multi-team initiative to build simulations with
game development tools, this project focused on creating Earth-like
environments that would be relatively easy to pull into any existing
game or simulation framework using the [Bevy Game
Engine](https://bevyengine.org/).

Many thanks to our project sponsor Dr. Patton, without whom this would
not have been possible. We are also tremendously grateful to our
instructors at Oregon State University, who were ready to help and
guide every step of the way. Though the project was finished and
prepared for release by Caelan and Chase, we could not have come as
far without Brandi, who prototyped the initial natural environments
that evolved into the current forest environment. Thank you all.
